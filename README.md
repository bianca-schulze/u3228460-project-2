## Overview 
Unlike the previous assignment, it felt as though I encountered more challenges than I did successes. This was likely due to a lack of familiarity with the MacOS Terminal and static site generators (SSG). Despite the challenges I faced, I am very happy with the end result and I am going to use the template I have created as my design portfolio in the future. 

## Challenges 

### MacOS Terminal  
The first major challenge occured when I was required to download the SSG using the MacOS terminal. I had never used the terminal before so I found it difficult to write bash scripts to use the terminal. In particular, when attempting to download Jekyll, I was faced with a security error that I struggled to diagnose. Ultimately, the decision was made to switch to a new SSG, 11ty. Thankfully, I had no issues downloading 11ty. This challenge did however set me back a few days as I was unable to progress until it was fixed. In the future, now that I have had the opportunity to work in the terminal, I will hopefully be able to bash, diagnose and run scripts more efficiently. 

### Linking different document types 
The second element of this assignment that I found challenging was determining how to link the markdown files to the html files. I understand the importance of inserting the content of your site into markdown files to allow for ease of maintenance. However, in practice, I found that I would naturally go to enter the content of the site into the html files, rather than the markdown files, because it was easier to style. This is not effective for the long-term maintenance of the website. In the future, I will spend more time upfront, to input tags in the markdown files so that I can reference the content in the html files, reducing the effort required to update the content. 

### Images 
One of the other challenges I faced that prevented me from progressing with sections of the website, was in relation to linking images. At first, I was unsure as to where the images should sit; whether they should be referenced in the markdown file or the html document. After testing in both locations and attempting to troubleshoot, I eventually determined that there was an error in my code that was preventing the images from displaying. As a temporary solution, I used background images that were externally linked to imgur. The permanent solution was to add a line of code to the javascript file. Once the line of script was added, I went back through the code and changed most of the background images to standard images. In the future, I would need to determine and fix the issue sooner, to avoid a duplication of work. 



## Successes 

### CSS Selectors
As this is the third website I have coded I have become confident with CSS selectors, especially when creating grids. Having this confidence allowed me to write the code from scratch, rather than finding examples of how the code is written. Familiarising myself with these elements has improved productivity, by reducing the effort required to learn the code and fix any errors. 

### Design Principles
When coding my previous websites, I would come up with the design myself. During this assignment, I decided it would be beneficial to seek inspiration from other websites to broaden the scope of my design. I think this really helped when choosing the colour scheme as I could see that most well designed sites used a colour palette consisting of only two or three colours. By conducting this desktop research prior to starting the assignment, I paid close attention to basic principles of design that were being used and ensured my site was balanced, well contrasted and used plenty of white space. Of all of the designs I have created, I believe this is the most aesthetically pleasing site I have developed. 

### Sought assistance
As mentioned in the challenges section, I faced a number of issues during the beginning of the project. Thankfully, by identifying these challenges early in the project, I was able to seek help from my peers to fix the errors before wasting too much time. Once I was happy with the site, I decided to reach out for feedback to see if I could add anything that would improve the site. This improved the final product mainly by removing a duplication of code. By doing so, I was not only able to learn more about static site generators, but also create a site that I am very happy with.
